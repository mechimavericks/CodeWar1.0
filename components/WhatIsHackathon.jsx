          A hackathon is an event where individuals from diverse backgrounds
          come together to collaboratively develop innovative solutions to
          real-world problems within a constrained timeframe, typically ranging
          from a few hours to a few days. Participants form teams, brainstorm
          ideas, and work intensively to create prototypes or functioning
          software, hardware, or other projects. Hackathons foster creativity,
          teamwork, and rapid problem-solving skills, offering a platform for
          participants to learn, network, and showcase their talents.
